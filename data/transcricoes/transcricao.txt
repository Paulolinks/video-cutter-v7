Like attracts like you have to understand you are a magnet Whatever you are. That's what you draw to you if you're negative. You're gonna draw negativity You positive you draw positive. You're a kind person more people are kind to you So you're like a magnet, you know And you got to understand something about like attracts like if you see it in your mind You can hold it in your hand. I want to tell you the most interesting story in the world Why a person becomes the person he becomes we become what we think about Most of the time and that's the stranger's secret. This is why thinking is so vital This is why a goal is so important because we will become that This is why people who set goals achieve them the trouble with men is not achieving their goals. They do that It's an establishing them your metal attitude is important because it acts as a magnet which attracts to you everything Every circumstance which makes you what you are and where you are Remember that your mental attitude is something you control outright and you must use self-discipline Until you create a thought better or thought habits which keep your mental attitude positive at all times If you wish to keep on the beam that leads to success Be sure that you give cosmic habit force a thought pattern based on the things you want most in life And it will do the rest you can have do or be anything you want if you control your mind Whatever you focus on with energy and repetition is what you're going to tend to bring into your life Most people don't realize that their thoughts are in the toilet. They're things like I'm not good enough It's not good to work out all of these kinds of negative thoughts keep people shut down They don't go for their dreams with the law of attraction is teaching people is that you have a choice You can change your thinking the estimates by the experts in this field are that most of us are using somewhere Around five percent of our real potential some experts say as little as one percent We're only experiencing five percent of the fun Five percent of the joy five percent of the rewards we could be knowing or less only experts are agreed that in each of us There are deep reservoirs of ability even genius that we habitually fail to use Why the problem with most people is that they're playing the world's most unrewarding game and the name of the game is Follow the follower got to create dream boards. You got to put the new car up on your mirror Put the weight you want to be on the refrigerator if you can see it in your mind. You can hold it in your hand That's the law of attraction. That's what you bring to you You already have within all it's required to attract literally whatever you want into your life You can see it in your head you can hold it in your hand because that is the frequency match the frequency of the good You desire if you hold the dream in your mind, and you don't let the outside world control you you have to attract Everything that you need and that space will fill in the way will be shown what you think and what you believe It's what will come true for you your thoughts create your life It's that simple and when we can get that we can make enormous changes Start to generate what you do want to think and this is where things like affirmations positive thinking positive statements Instead of saying I'm not good enough begin to say I am good enough a reticular activating system in the brain responds the repetition Imagery and emotion aim where you want to go by choosing what you want getting an image of what you want Feeling it with passion and love then you can start to create it almost organically and automatically The only thing about a man that is a man is his mind everything else you can find in a pig or a horse To think deliberately and with a purpose to spend a little time each day before a blank sheet of paper with our goal Perhaps written at the top and come up with some fresh new and exciting ideas Gratitude is a powerful process The only way to move to the next level is you must show gratitude for where you are if you show gratitude It gets you to where you want to be quicker very true The brain doesn't know the difference between an actual experience and an imagined experience if I Anticipate surgery and I'm afraid of the surgery. I'll release the same flood of hormones as the surgical procedure In fact, I might release even more if I think in my mind that I'm watching the Sun my pupils will dilate if I think in my mind I'm in the darkness the pupils will contract if I think I'm holding some hot coals in my hands The temperature will go up if I think I'm holding ice in the sand the temperature will go down So every wisp of thought releases a flood of hormones and chemicals and chemical messengers and every little cell in your body is eavesdropping on that If you're worried about something the worry about the experience causes as much problem as the actual experience If not more and finally the strangest secret what makes a child grow up into the human being he becomes Well, this is the reason for that is that he becomes what he thinks about Most of the time It's as simple as that ask Believe receive So many people overlook this very simple quality. You don't have to figure it out That's what freezes people when you're trying to figure out your life all the way to the end when you can't figure it out It freezes you from trying it because you go. Oh, I can't figure that out. Oh, I can't go over there because I don't know How you don't have to know how you have to ask believe and receive science says Show me and I'll believe Faith says believe and I'll show you the law of attractions is secondary law It's not a primary law. It's a secondary law the primary law is a law of vibration Yeah, you're not on the frequency You're not gonna attract it the image you impress upon the subconscious controls your vibration yet the vibration controls Your track see yet dictates the frequency you're on you can only attract what's on the frequency You've got to get emotionally involved with this new image. You've got to see it happening Yeah, if you dial someone's number, you're not gonna get me. You got to dial my number to get me Yep, I don't dial your number. I'm not gonna get you you get back from the universe What it is that you put out there in the world and if you're putting out there into the world that I am not worthy Of attracting something beautiful into my life the universe will respond back to you with exactly that message But if you believe inside that is limited that you can only get so much that other people are gonna get it before you do Then you'll find yourself creating that very same thing and the interesting thing about all of this The irony of this is that if you shift that and you say to the universe to the world How may I serve the universe's response back to you is how many I serve you? I think it's good to remember that if we just go along with the crowd We won't wind up with much more than the wish that we could do it all over again in as far as we know you can't If we want to amount to anything as individuals, we need individual goals Individual thinking individual actions and we must never conform to the big group Laster attracts joy and it releases Negativity and it leads to some miraculous killing Joy and depression cannot reside in the same space Let every chance you get just bust out left and even if it ain't funny just laugh I'm gonna tell you right now the law of attraction is real What is the law of attraction the attractive magnet of power of the universe that draws similar energies together this law attracts stops ideas People's situation and circumstances the idea is if you believe That something is going to happen no matter what it is Eventually it's gonna happen whatever you want if you believe I can't do this I am going to achieve this you will achieve it bottom up if you say I can't It's impossible the law of attraction works both ways either Positive energy or negative so the word can't should never ever be in your The question is not why I can't or how I can't it's what can I do to achieve this? See if you shall find knock and it shall be answered unto you So once you pursue something that thing that you're pursuing also attracts itself to use is the law of Magnetism and whatever you are you attract when you're praying and you're grateful that that's the elevated thought that you're Bringing into creation into existence only man has the God-like power to make his surroundings change to fit him because his environment would change as he changes a man's environment Is a merciless mirror of him as a human being and if he thinks his environment can stand a little improvement All he has to do is improve and his environment will improve to reflect the changing man Champions expect to win they have winning Expectations faith is simply an expectation of something good or an expectation of something bad either way We get what we expect if we expect defeat will probably end up getting defeat if we expect victory We're gonna get victory. You see winning doesn't mean you don't fall winning doesn't mean you never fail It just means you get back up and you expect to win you expect to win no matter what happens You don't lose your confidence. Don't throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. It's not cockiness It's not arrogance. It's not pride confidence is knowing who you are this is life to believe something's possible Perhaps the greatest weapon one can have in their arsenal when you believe Something is possible the question goes from can I to how will I the gap is bridged the terrain is crossed? Because time is not exhausted on the likelihood of the outcome, but on its materialization If you ever had an experience where you're thinking about somebody and the telephone rings and it's them if you're had an experience where you phone somebody else And they say we were just talking about you It just leaps into your mind if you're had an experience when you're in tune with your husband or wife You think you know I'd like to go out to dinner at such and such a place tonight and you call home And they will say why don't we go up to dinner at such and such a place? These are all examples of this law of attraction the law of attraction is considered by many to be one of the most important laws of human Existence in this you will always attract to yourself Positive or negative people and circumstances that harmonize with your dominant thoughts that whatever you're thinking on a continuing basis You're attracting into your life. You're drawing it into your life like a magnet That's why it's so important that you keep your thoughts on what you want Keep your thoughts on what you desire and keep your thoughts off of what you don't want And by the way as you advance and develop and become more proficient and more sharp with these methods The law of attraction will work faster for you and with greater accuracy the biggest difference between People who win and people who lose is that winners expect to win winners are not surprised when they win Like when I win I don't like celebrate overly celebrate because I expected that to be the outcome amateurs when they win They're surprised and then they over celebrate and like I said when they over celebrate They become ineffective because they're taking their eye off the game for way too long Right I won the week this week and then they talk about that one week for the next six weeks and the next six weeks The guy who expected to win is still going just as hard So it's an expectation That's the difference between winners and losers that I think in terms of not so much their self-talk But just their attitude believe that it has been given or that you already have it then you will receive it He doesn't say you believe that you will receive it. He says believe that you have received it the very Foundation for successful manifestation is finding who you are in your essence and once you've found that That already contains everything that you could wish for on a feeling level Whatever you attain then It comes out of the state of fullness not out of state of lag Attitude has been called the most important word in any language in the world Because it's our attitude toward our world toward all the people in it that will determine the world's attitude and all the people's attitude toward us It's a simple thing most of us know it, but we tend to forget it people will react to us According to our attitude and our attitude is the greatest gift We can be given I saw what the law of attraction was it was a natural law that not only does science say it works And the Bible says it works the rich get rich of the poor good poor talking about relationships We're talking about money. We're talking about health. We're talking about everything You know you tracked what you think at the end of the day I saw that that law of attraction is actually a scientific law that we're given such as aerodynamics Buoyancy gravity is working right now You're probably not even thinking of it also the law of attraction works to the rich get rich you poor your poor like attracts Like I started praying and you think like it's already done. It's like when you pray You don't pray at all, please no heal my back I'm hurt. No, you say thank you God for my perfect health for my healing. You pray like it's already done Then you got a better shot at it. Nothing is impossible As long as you really believe it and trust yourself You think it's your destiny think it's your your best right your destiny to my friend you have to make your destiny I woke up and I suddenly got it I understood suddenly how thought was just an illusory thing and how Thought is responsible for if not all most of the suffering we experience And then I suddenly felt like I was looking at these thoughts from another perspective And I wondered who is it that's aware that I'm thinking and suddenly I was thrown into this expansive amazing feeling of freedom from myself from my problems I saw that I was bigger than what I do. I was bigger than my body I was everything and everyone. I was no longer a fragment of the universe I was the universe the biggest lesson that I've learned is the power of the mind and just how important it is to Look at yourself at a high regard and to believing yourself I think in order to paint a bright future for yourself You have to be able to see it in your mind You have to believe in it and the more you believe in it You know the more how your world start to change the more you'll just start to you know See your beliefs kind of pass. You must assume that you already are What you want to be and then live by faith in this assumption Living from the end Means that you call the things which do not exist as if they did It will chase after you if you can place into your imagination What it is that you would like to attract and begin to feel it that which you feel yourself to be You are and you are given that which you are so assume the feeling that would be yours Were you already in possession of your wish and your wish must be realized and when you believe something is possible Everything else will figure itself out You have got to start expecting great things to happen for you in order for it to happen It is the law of attraction. It is real. It is nothing fake about a man is as he thinking If you live your life in expectations, that's what happens to you If you live your life in despair, that's what happens to you If you say all men are dogs, you're gonna meet every last one of them I'll never be rich. You won't you won't the moment you change the frequency that your tower emits The moment you change that frequency different things come back to you. I'm telling you this how it works I'm gonna just say this fast as I can. I'm gonna let you go if you change your attitude you change your You've got to bet on you You believe in everybody else you plan for everybody else you support everybody else you're making cakes and making cookies for everybody else But when are you gonna look in the mirror and believe in the dirt person you see? It's about time for you to believe in you and remember to think Imagination is everything and we can become what we can imagine. There's a little rule of thumb You might want to remember whatever the great majority is doing under any given circumstance If you do exactly the opposite you'll probably never make another mistake as long as you'll live The person with the positive little attitude strikes up opportunity favorable opportunities just like I've made it to try to see you So if you're talking about manifesting your dreams, well It only requires two things it requires a clear intention and intention is a vision a Possibility the moment you say what would it be like to be healthy? What would it be like to be wealthy? What would you like to have a new home would like to have a great job and you get this idea in your mind? That's intention then you write down the details Okay, I want to travel around the world. I want to have great benefits great insurance I want to work with really cool people I want to have a chance to be creative and you list all of those individual elements to Fortify your dream the more you get clear on those details the more your brain begins to work in new ways Anytime you make your brain work differently, you're changing your mind. You can create anything you want in your life It's how powerful you are That's what we're here to do on earth is to learn how to create your reality That's the main reason you're here to learn how to create what you want in your life You figure out you're the one in charge of your own life Nobody else is doing it but you if you don't like what's happening in your life Recreating first. You got to understand what you want You know, you can't create anything if you don't know what you want You figure out what you want in your life then you can have it It's a long universe if it meant to be if it's supposed to be your path No, just go very smoothly and easy and everything will fall into place If you know that you were destined for something that you were fated for something that you have a sense that your life had a meaning a Purpose and you can withstand the traumas the setbacks the difficulties the bulk and criticism and all the other things This is the most incredible method I've ever seen I learned it some years ago Just rewrite your goals every morning because every time you write your goals down your programming into your subconscious mind When you program them into your subconscious mind you set up a field of vibration within your brain And this law of attraction based on this field of vibration attracts into your life people and circumstances that harmonize with your dominant thoughts What you do is you create a force field which we cannot explain scientifically But it is a field of vibration that goes out from you and attracts back into your life Everything that you need to realize your dominant goals You can have anything you want imagine you could have anything that you want anything that you can hold in your mind on a continuing basis You can have the pain of what you're feeding is nothing compared to the joy that's coming and the reality is that's that's life And it no matter what situation happens Sign goods coming everything you're going through is preparing you for what you ask for the world belongs to optimists Because if you're going to do anything big you have to believe that it can happen believe in yourself And don't and don't rely on anybody to believe in you Don't rely on anybody to push you or make you better and allow that human being To make you a better person if you don't have the mind said that you're the best ever You failed already, but before you can ever reach anything you have to believe it You don't just mistakenly become great at something wherever you are the universe will rise up to meet you with the dream But this is a thing the dream has to be a pure dream This is a thing that people miss that there's also true for the law of attraction and the mistake that people make is they like Well, I wish for it and I really want that and that didn't happen you have to be in pure alignment with what is whatever it is You're wishing for so your heart has to be pure and your intention has to be pure in order for it to come in It's not it doesn't happen through. Yes It does not come through if you really are in fear or resentment or resist resistance toward it So if you really want something but deep down inside like your real intention is I'm not gonna get it. I'm not gonna get it I don't deserve it. I don't know nothing good ever happens to me that energy will block whatever it is from coming towards you So the universe rises up to meet you in the purest of your heart a lot of expectations Over and over is what you expect you get you get not what you want But what you expect that your expectations Especially your expectations about outcomes how you think things are going to turn out become your own self-fulfilling Prophecy and dr. Robert Rosenthal of you Harvard University has done something like 300 experiments on Expectations theory on what is called experiment or theory and he finds that your expectations have an effect on other people and Events and circumstances even if your expectations are based on totally false information Whatever you expect with confidence in other words if you confidently expect good things to happen Surprise surprise good things happen to you if you confidently expect negative things to happen then negative things are going to happen to you That most successful people have developed an attitude of constantly expecting good things to happen It's called the attitude of positive Self-expectancy it is the attitude of the winner the winner looks for good things to happen the winner expects to win most successful people Live urgently the most successful people are impatient the most successful people have high Expectations of themselves and of the people around them the most successful people are competitive See successful people know that they only have a fine out of mind of time is to go out and execute be the black sheep be different Stand out feel forward feel fast get up and re-execute execute execute and when you do you will win and you will become an Asset to humanity not a liability and you will see the world differently and you will have experiences by the way For yourself and your family the people that you love that are unmatched and just amazing when you're reaching goal You're gonna act like you're already there. It's already happened intellectually the second you think about it It's already happened emotionally when you're emotionally involved with it So it's only a period of time until it manifests in physical form But because it's not in physical form we act like I'm got it yet That's why most people stay stuck because they're acting like they haven't got it yet You see yourself your imagination you're gonna be that person you've got to be it intellectually You've got to be it emotionally well It's only a period of time until it manifests physically that's one of the first laws of the universe is a perpetual transportation of energy Energy is moving into form. Oh, people can't get up in the morning and they can't get out of bed I'm gonna tell you why because they can predict the feeling of everything that's gonna happen in their life And their bodies resigned to the familiar. It says oh another mundane day But remember when you were a kid and you were going on a field trip What happened then you were up and dressed and ready to go before your parents were up You know why because you knew something unexpected was gonna happen. That's how we should live our lives Waking up with the understanding that we expect the unexpected and something unusual should happen in our life as a result of our efforts And it's just those beginning moments where it begins to happen that we begin to prove to ourselves how powerful we really are So take time in the morning in the evening and the rest of the day Check in with yourself at certain times to see if you're still in that energy And if you're not excuse yourself for a second raise your energy and step back into your life Whenever you wake up in the morning today is going to be a great day. You have to nudge your brain We have a conscious mind. We have an unconscious mind. We have a self image and Your subconscious is paying attention to the words that the conscious mind is saying and so if you're like Oh, I don't want to get out of bed today is gonna be a bad day You're gonna have a bad day because you just programmed your subconscious mind to do that every day when my feet hit the floor Today is going to be a great day And I've been doing this for years and it's so helpful focus on the future Versus the past focus on what is going to be done differently in the future Rather than what has happened in the past. Why is that a very simple reason if the person's not control the past not being able to control the past Any criticism over what they've done in the past causes them tremendous stress and frustration The key to success in life is a positive mental attitude a positive mental attitude is based on expectations of success of a positive set of expectancies Positive set of expectancies is based on beliefs and your self-concept the core of your self-concept Which determines your effectiveness in life is your self-esteem and your self-esteem is measured by how much you like yourself The two things that hold us back more than anything else are the fears of failure and the fears of rejection So one of the core secrets of success is this is become a perpetual self-esteem Generating organism continually be doing things for yourself through yourself in your life that caused you to like yourself To love yourself to accept yourself to respect yourself that caused you to feel terrific about yourself If you have big goals they motivate you they stimulate you they excite you they enthuse you You have no goals at all you just go around in circles What we have found is that goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement and the more you work on the goals and the more you feel yourself progressing toward them the better you feel the more positive you feel the more momentum you develop and the more you Feel yourself to be Unstoppable Whatever you want to do believe it believe it believe it even if you don't believe play the game of belief Act as if you believe that is power that is sheer power and it will happen believe you me believe believe believe Life is much too short to live fearfully to settle for less than the best it's in us We can become only what we expect of ourselves We must act the part before it can become real what you dream. What do you want like what happiness and joy? What material things want super health on a great relationship? You can have it all the external world we're living in the conditions Experiences is a reflection of what is within if you get within you pure beautiful The external world will change but you have to change the inside first and then give yourself time to succeed when you change the inside first It's like planting seeds. You don't plant a seed walk out the next day and go Where's the tree you planted the seed you have to water it and verbalize it and give it time And then it sprouts and then you give it time and it gets the sun and then it begins to grow That's how things manifest law of assumption states whatever I assume in life I'm bound to get whatever I assume in my life I'm bound to get because when you meet other people whatever you assume well, they're gonna assume it too If you could do that really well and keep practice and falling in love with your future the stronger the emotion you feel The more you remember your future and to the brain it's exactly the same The brain is literally being branded by that image and the brain does not know the difference in that moment between the real life experience And the experience that you're having in your mind You see what you say is what you get your tongue is a creative force Words have power more power than you could ever imagine Every word that comes out of your mouth has 100 to a thousand times more power than a thought if you believe that what you say will happen You will get whatever you say People want me to do everything for them when what they don't realize is They have the power You want to see a miracle son? Be the miracle Expect big things think big think big you can do it. You can do it. Why do I can't do it Take a little bit of peace at a time of daily goals monthly goals. You can make it happen It can happen what's impossible in your life go after that have that go after what's impossible One of the greatest statements ever heard in my life that helps me even today the way you want to live in life is Expect the best do all that you can Well, I always knew that I would be successful It was never a question of whether I'm not I would be successful. It was just a matter of time You're bored with feeling that you're special. I know that sounds and this isn't this isn't bold or anything I mean you really have a feeling that you are here for something and some people don't have that feeling and when you have that feeling you know And it's it's a matter of just pacing yourself and learning as much as you can learn until the time comes when you're out there Expect the worst but hopefully the best I don't do that I hope for the best and I expect the best if some bad happen that it was a test keep moving forward, baby Let me tell you something. You got to become a millionaire before you become a millionaire You got to be living in that beautiful house that you dream about before you be living in that beautiful house You got to drive that car that you fantasize about driving and you dream about driving before you get that car because let me tell you something It's about the mindset everything that you put in your mind everything that you program in your mind Everything that you think about in your mind will come to life We're looking for the good always expecting the best always believing Trusting be absolutely convinced that something good is going to come out of everything that happens to you This attitude of confident expectation seems to be what puts you the foot on the accelerator of the super conscious mind And bring things bring things into your life and people and what you need in your life Faster and faster and faster begin to become great as a human being To the degree which you tap into and go with the flow of this super conscious energy Other than that life is always a struggle But once you get into the flow of this energy life seems to be on the downhill side You seem to be going with the current get it to the point where you're plugged into the super conscious mind continuously And you just go with the flow of life That all the things that you require the answers that you need the solutions the people the circumstances will be drawn into your life And exactly the order exactly the sequence that you require And the people that you don't need to certain samples that are old In certain sense, there's nothing to do with where you're going They fall off as exactly as they're no longer needed And the more you use it the more you believe in it the more you're accustomed to it The more rapidly and definitively and predictably it works
